# UGA-Codehub-Apartment-Searcher
This is a website deisgned to help UGA students find student apartments and filter them out via their preferences.

This is a Web-Application:

This application requires Node.js to run a local server on your computer. This is because the apartment objects from the web scrapper are stored in a JSON format and in order to retrieve those objects you need to run a server instance, and we are broke college students and cant afford to host this on a server.

Node.js setup instructions:

You can download Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/ Then in your terminal use the command, ''npm install -g live-server''. Clone this repository, navigate to the html folder and run the command ''live-server' in your terminal and the program will run a localized instance of a web server running the index.html file.
